# Fences

A simple application that can calculate the amount of posts and railings required to build a fence of a certain length or that will calculate the length of a fence when you provide the amount of posts and railings.

In addition to the basic challenge spec, I build a custom router for the application in order to learn how routing is done by common MVC frameworks.

Built with HTML & PHP according to object-oriented design principles.
