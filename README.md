# Fences

A PHP application that can calculate the amount of posts and railings required to build a fence of a certain length or that will calculate the length of a fence when you provide the amount of posts and railings.

In addition, I built a custom server-side router for this simple application in order to learn how frameworks might implement routing solutions.

Built only with HTML & PHP according to object-oriented design principles.
